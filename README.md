**My Meme**

*In this project I used r code to make my own animated meme from this inspo meme and then use r markdown to create my html page.*

In this r code, I have used these functions:
1. c()
2. image_blank()
3. image_read()
4. image_annotate()

I have also:
* Used pipes e.g %>%
* Used named objects e.g meme <- image_read(url)
* Used comments e.g. # note to self
* Made use of indenting and â€œwhite space

This is a link to the inspo meme I chose.
